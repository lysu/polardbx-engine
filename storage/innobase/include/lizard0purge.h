  Here's an explanation of the changes associated with zeus and purge sys.
  In the past, when committing, innodb holds rseg::mutex, trx_sys::mutex to
  generate new trx_id as a commited number called trx_no for a trx, and then
  holds trx_sys::mutex, rseg::mutex, and purge_sys::pq_mutex to add resgs to
  purge_sys::purge_queue. So, we get the following conclusions:
  c-a. The history list in rollback segments is ordered.
  c-b. The purge_queue is ordered.

  Now, we only hold rseg::mutex to generate a new scn number, and then hold
  rseg::mutex and purge_sys::pq_mutex to add resgs to purge_sys::purge_heap.
  So, the above c-b is not statistified. There is a possible
  problem:
  p-a: purge_sys->iter.scn might advance purge_sys->vision.scn. The later
       rseg might be pushed to purge_sys::purge_heap first. In function
       **trx_purge_rseg_get_next_history_log** set purge_sys->iter.scn as
       rseg->last_scn + 1, and push the rseg in purge_heap. And then set_next
       might choose the pointed records, whose scn is possible larger than
       purge_sys->iter.scn, to purge.

  purge sys should never purge those records whose scn less than
  purge_sys->vision.scn.
